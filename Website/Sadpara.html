<h2><b>Muhammad Ali Sidpara</b></h2>
<p>
    <cite>Muhammad Ali Sadpara</cite>, known as Ali Sadpara (born 2 February 1976 – disappeared 5 February 2021) was a Pakistani high-altitude mountaineer. He was part of the team that successfully achieved the first ever winter summit on Nanga Parbat in 2016. Both his teammates, Alex Txikon and Simone Moro, have gone on record stating that they could not have done it without Sadpara's brilliance. He had successfully climbed four eight-thousanders in a calendar year and a total of eight in his career.

    Sadpara and his 21-year-old son Sajid Sadpara, who had climbed K2 in 2019, teamed up with Icelandic mountaineer John Snorri Sigurjónsson and Chilean mountaineer Juan Pablo Mohr Prieto for a joint K2 ascent, leaving the highest camp on the evening of 4 February 2021. Sajid had to descend due to a technical issue, leaving the others at the Bottleneck, close to the summit. His father, Snorri, and Mohr kept climbing up, but they didn't come back by night as planned. On 5 February 2021, Ali Sadpara along with John Snorri and Juan Pablo Mohr went missing while attempting to ascend K2. A rescue mission with two army helicopters was organized on 6 February.
